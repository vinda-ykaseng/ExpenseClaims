# Project Proposal

## Overview
A solution to replace the manual claims process that the AP Department currently uses.

## Objectives
* Streamline Claims workflow
* Export the relevant data out into an Excel Stylesheet at the end of the month to be inserted into SAP, and eventually Oracle.
* Track if the approved budget for overseas travel has been exceeded in Pre-Approval & Cash Advance.

## Scope
List of forms to be digitalized:
* Pre-Approval & Cash Advance
* Expense Claims (Expense, Mileage, Meal Allowance)
* Marriage, Newborn & Funeral
* Lost Receipt Declaration

## Proposed Solution
A Rapid4 application that streamlines the Claims workflow by removing the need for redundant data entry actions. The system should also keep track of the progress of claims which are still open, notify and acquire approvals from relevant individuals as the forms progress down their respective information flow. The system should also have a dashboard for the users to track the progress of the claims they have submitted. The solution would also include an interface for administrators to assist with day to day management. The administrator interface would allow for slight changes in configurations. For instance, the administrator would be able to replace a designated recepient for another.
